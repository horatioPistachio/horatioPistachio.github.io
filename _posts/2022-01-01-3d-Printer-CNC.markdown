This is an old makerbot replicator 2 whose hotend broke. instead of stripping it for parts, I decide to turn it into a CNC. I used a dremmel as the tool and created a mount to attached it to the printer. Fusion 360 CAM was used to create the toolpaths and export to gcode. From this some post processing need to be done to remove commands that don't make sense on the printer and then to convert into the makerbot file type. All in all the CNC works reasonably well. It does sometimes unfortunatly slip and then the axis are off. The dremmel could also be more powerful.
