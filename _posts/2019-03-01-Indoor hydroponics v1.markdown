This is the first* attempt at an indoor hydroponics system. The tank is made from a laser cut box covered in bathroom sealer to make it water proof. The system is controlled by a raspberry pi. The lights and pump are controlled by relays. The relays are controlled by the raspberry pi. They can be programed by a website on the pi.

The light are COTS modules that run a 5v. The pump is a cheap one off ebay. The pump forces water through some small holes in the white pipe to create a drip system. Being cheap, it was the first part to break.

Being a first attempt, many things were kludged togehter. for example, the lights run off a different power supply to the rest of the system and the webserver writes to a text file when the form is submitted.

Fortunately, the system was able to successfully grow plants.

*I have had several other attempts at outdoor versions however they had several major design flaws.
