Ages ago I found some old speakers in hard rubbish. They were good quality but the box was all torn up. I ripped off all of the water logged and destroyed wood and replaced it where it was needed, then I putted up all the cracks and sanded and painted them in a brilliant mint green. They are powered off the bench power supply that I also made. I bought a car amp for half price and hooked it all up (they sound awesome). Initially I tried to use a potentiometer to control volume, however the car amp drew basically 0 current hence no voltage drop. To solve this I converted the volume control circuit to a voltage divider. Used some fancy math (not really ;) ) to get an idea of a rough range of resistors I'll need. I threw it all together and it works pretty good. Has a super sensitive zone near max volume ( the fancy math told me it would happen). To fix this I'll need a new potentiometer which ranges from about 0-2k and linear. Probably won't make this addition as it is minimal. Currently used as sick as bedside tables. Motivation was that I have a record player and wanted to play through them for the aesthetic and I was having a 21st that I needed some decent speakers for.
