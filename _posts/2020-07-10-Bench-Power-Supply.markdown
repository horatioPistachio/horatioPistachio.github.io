I needed a better way to power my projects than a dodgy 12v switching power supply rated at 1 amp. So I had an old computer psu lying around. I prettied it up and add some switches and banana sockets and now I have 20 amp at 12v, 5v and 3.3v all decorated in one of the best tv shows ever Motivation was that I needed a bigger power supply.
