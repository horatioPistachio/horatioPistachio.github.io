This is one of those standard side show games where you have a hammer and smash a target as hard as you can. I made it with a friend. He did the structure whilst I did the electronics. Initially i thought this would be a really easy project, turns out it wasn't. An interesting problem was that the acceleration when you hit something is very high. This meant that any acceleration sensor we could buy wouldn't be able to accurately measure the hit due to maxing out. To solve this we used angular velocity. Acceleration is the derivative of velocity hence all the information to find acceleration is in the velocity. Motivation was that my friend helps out at a christmas carnival in pt elliot and wanted the game to be played there. I have no photos of the completed project :(
